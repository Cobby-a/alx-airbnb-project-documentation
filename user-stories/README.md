# User Stories Documentation

This directory contains the `user-stories.md` file, which translates the system's use cases into specific, goal-oriented statements.

## Purpose

User stories define the functionality from the perspective of the end-user (Guest, Host, or Admin). They serve as the foundation for sprint planning, development tasks, and acceptance criteria throughout the project lifecycle.
