# Backend Features and Functionalities

This document outlines the essential features and functionalities the Airbnb Clone backend needs to support, derived from the project's core, technical, and non-functional requirements. This serves as a blueprint for development and will guide the creation of the backend API design and implementation.

## üîë Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration:**
    - Allow users to sign up as `guests` or `hosts`.
    - Implement secure authentication methods (e.g., JWT).
- **User Login and Authentication:**
    - Implement login via email and password.
    - Support OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Profile Management:**
    - Enable users to update their profiles (e.g., photos, contact info, preferences).

### 2. Property Listings Management
- **Add Listings (Hosts):**
    - Hosts can create property listings with details (title, description, location, price, amenities, availability).
- **Edit/Delete Listings (Hosts):**
    - Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering
- **Search Functionality:**
    - Allow users to find properties by location, price range, number of guests, amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly).
- **Pagination:**
    - Implement pagination for large search result datasets.

### 4. Booking Management
- **Booking Creation (Guests):**
    - Guests can book a property for specified dates.
    - Implement date validation to prevent double bookings.
- **Booking Cancellation (Guests/Hosts):**
    - Allow cancellation based on defined cancellation policies.
- **Booking Status Tracking:**
    - Track statuses: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`.

### 5. Payment Integration
- **Secure Payment Gateway Implementation:**
    - Handle upfront payments by guests (e.g., via Stripe, PayPal).
    - Manage automatic payouts to hosts after booking completion.
    - Support multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- **Guest Reviews:**
    - Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
    - Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.
- **Host Responses:**
    - Hosts can respond to reviews.

### 7. Notifications System
- **Automated Notifications:**
    - Implement email and in-app notifications for:
        - Booking confirmations
        - Cancellations
        - Payment updates

### 8. Admin Dashboard
- **Administrative Interface:**
    - Monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management
- **Relational Database:**
    - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Required Tables:**
    - Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments.

### 2. API Development
- **RESTful APIs:**
    - Expose backend functionalities using RESTful principles (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).
- **GraphQL (Optional):**
    - Consider for complex data fetching scenarios.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT:**
    - Implement JWT for secure user sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - Differentiate permissions for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.

### 4. File Storage
- **Cloud Storage:**
    - Store property images and user profile photos (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary).

### 5. Third-Party Services
- **Email Services:**
    - Integrate SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
- **Robust System:**
    - Implement global error handling for APIs and comprehensive logging.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- **Modular Architecture:**
    - Design for easy scaling with increased traffic.
- **Horizontal Scaling:**
    - Utilize load balancers for horizontal scaling.

### 2. Security
- **Data Encryption:**
    - Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payment info).
- **Protective Measures:**
    - Implement firewalls and rate limiting.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Caching:**
    - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- **Query Optimization:**
    - Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

### 4. Testing
- **Automated Testing:**
    - Implement unit and integration tests (e.g., using pytest).
    - Include automated API testing.
